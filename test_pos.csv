Super simple place but amazing nonetheless Its been around since the 30s and they still serve the same thing they started with a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard Staff was very helpful and friendly
Small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant Call for a reservation We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains Everything was incredible I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go A bit outside of downtown montreal but take the metro out and its less than a 10 minute walk from the station
Lesters is located in a beautiful neighborhood and has been there since 1951 They are known for smoked meat which most delis have but their brisket sandwich is what I come to montreal for Theyve got about 12 seats outside to go along with the inside The smoked meat is up there in quality and taste with Schwartzs and youll find less tourists at Lesters as well
Cycle Pub Las Vegas was a blast Got a groupon and rented the bike for 11 of us for an afternoon tour Each bar was more fun than the last Downtown Las Vegas has changed so much and for the better We had a wide age range in this group from early 20s to mid 50s and everyone had so much fun Our driver Tony was knowledgable  friendly and just plain fun Would recommend this to anyone looking to do something different away from the strip You wont be disappointed
Love this placePeggy is great with dogs and does a great job She is very patience with him and will make any adjustments you need before you leave the store My little guy has no problems coming hereThey also have very good bully sticks the nonsmelly ones that my little guy and his friends love
This place is awesome Definitely authenticMy two favourite dishes are the rice flour rolls and the chicken pho The rice flour rolls are always fresh whenever Im there And the chicken pho is always flavourful mmmmjust thinking of it makes me want someMy boyfriend is Vietnamese and he agrees that this place is authentic and one of the best Vietnamese restaurants he has ever eaten atPrices are very reasonable too
OMG  Definitely worth going if you are in MontrealAnd remember to eat it fresh  it is amazing paired with an organic cream cheese mmmm
This review is mainly for the pool onlyLove that it has a nice indoor salt water pool for the doggies to use It is small and only meant for 1 dog at a time I have a small little one that makes this size work well for him but not sure how the bigger dogs can really swim in hereThe pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is coldFor the 1st time users they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do that way you dont scared them off from swimmingAfter that you are free to book time for just you and your pupAnd they have a tub outside of the pool to bath them when they are doneOverall no complaints with them
This place is really good The best restaurant in the area The food there is really tasty  especially the Ahi Tuna Club sandwich Lobster Ravioli and the tandoori chicken flat breadThey also have mock chicken for those who are vegetariansGorgeous patio for the summer time
Suzanne was able to get my business five TV segments in the first two weeks of hiring her  Very honest and professional  Just a wonderful human being  I really enjoyed working with her  She is a fantastic communicator  She is the best PR in the valley
We had these guys cater our wedding  We ended up having 6 different flavors of cake  All were delicious although the carrot cake was especially exceptional  The staff was friendly and prepared All around a great experience
Visiting from SF  Checked yelp and found this place  It is very small  a converted house  As you sit in it you can watch the kitchen  The food was excellent  We had an eggplantred pepper omelet and peach waffles  The waffles were light and fluffy with fresh whipped cremeWe got pastries to go which were also good in particular the chocolate croissant was uniqueGreat place for an informal breakfast
I went here with my husband and another couple as the start to our double date night I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and Im glad I did but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us which was very nice of them because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats I have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there It is directly on Bloor but in a small mall which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street so you would never think to just walk into this placemaybe thats the point The decor of the restaurant is really lovely They have a huge stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor The bathrooms are large individually sectioned off stall with white and black tiles everywhere and large vintage French ads on the walls Two of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious They were also offering some Winterlicious cocktailsI had three the same one and they were excellent Our appetizers included two salads which looked great and according to the orderes were My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellentThe main courses included steak from the regular menu which were ordered with steak frites The steak was a nice cut of meat prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli which we all tried and was really goodThe lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu Lasagna came in a rounded dish where it had been baked and was on the smaller side but satisfying within a three course meal My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice I had the pistachio chicken which was a huge dish The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken but in dark meat Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish I couldnt finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well The reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious was because of the dessert The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer but the desserts set the prix fixe apart On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble or chocolate mousse Neither of which I really cared for although I tried it from my husband and it was good On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule which I have heard good things about and a sticky toffee cake I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee because it was such a lovely winter dessert I had been set on the creme brule but you know whatbrules are a dime a dozen How many places have sticky toffee cake I was NOT disappointed The cake was amazing It was a small singular bundt cake topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm caramel It was decadent and delicious Finally Ill mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way We all left very happy and satisfied This place is a little on the pricier end would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had but its great for a nice night out or a romantic date I will definitely come back some time in the future
I was so surprised to see the negative reviews of this place after having just had such a good experience there I went with a bunch of friends from work Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti which was great and Im not a huge wine drinker The ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates garnished with a garlic bread crouton I dont think the salads were anything special but I find that caesar salads in general arent so peoples complaints about them below seem largely unfounded I ordered the baked goat cheese appetizerOMG it was SO good Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reductionto DIE for For my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola which was also fabulous The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan but grilled veggies instead of the pasta the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food One woman I was with IS a chef so I feel like that was saying something Now since I didnt taste their dishes I can only expand on my own The sauce was to DIE for Creamy complex and delicious The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent I would order that dish again in a heartbeat Since we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations we went for it and ordered dessert even though we were all stuffed We all ordered the white chocolate creme brûlée except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed Our creme brûlées were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside Perfect The tiramisu was apparently great served very untraditionally in a large plate with an indentation like a bowl in the middle I was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeinefree cappuccinos so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was greatAltogether my meal came to $50 tip included which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out but not crazy Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks That would obviously have increased the price The restaurant atmosphere is nothing special but Im disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isnt half as good so this wasnt a concern for me The restaurant was clean and comfy but the furniture was a little on the older side like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmothers home and fake paintings on the walls   The service was excellent Our waitress saw to our every need answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly So was it perfect Well as I said the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average but those did not pose major problems I would ultimately give this place 412 but since I cant and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad it gets a 5 I would go back in a heartbeat
We got recommendations for this place from my parents and so for our anniversary we booked here We were told though that it was first come first served in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the Bellagio and The StripWe went for lunch though so it wasnt too busy We were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls with cheese and herbs infused They were deliciousWe ordered the onion soup to start and I ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger Our food came and was delicious The soup was probably my favorite part We were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse on a decorated plate that said Happy Anniversary which was a total surprise they had asked when I booked if it was a special occasion but had said nothing while we were thereOverall the service was great the food delicious and the view wonderful It was a great experience
I am surprised at the people complaining about the service because we found the service to be fine Especially given how busy and cramped it was There were no tables but they got us seats at the bar The music was maybe a little loud but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening The place looks like a dive its a total hole in the wall with no signs to speak of but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird old ghetto blasters on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator Its random just go with itBut the foodOH the FOOD We were told that the squash poutine was a must have so I ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel The mackerel was served first It arrived raw on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting with a delicious marinade Next came by bulgogi sandwich Fresh delicious bread and amazing bulgogi Was very pleased Finally the poutines arrived I should say that it was not what we were expecting I assumed it would be squash on top of fries But in fact the squash was the fries THey were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce gravies and scallions and some other stuff that I could neither make out nor even see clearly dim lighting It doesnt matter okaythis stuff was HEAVEN Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each otherand proclaimed our new favourite food Other people in our party got the wings which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey which was also proclaimed as delicious So basically there were no wrong moves The drink menu was very adventurousmore so than we were because we didnt take the plunge although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them And splitting the bill for my friend with two others her birthday my two tapas and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30 The prices are extremely reasonableand honestly once you try this stuffI mean I dont want to give them any ideas but I would have paid more for that fine fine food I will be back Need me some more of that poutine
I have been craving schnitzel for a LONG time so on the night of my birthday my husband and I decided to come here Cafe Polonez was in a great little area with lots of nice little shops surrounding it and High Park of course The restaurant is clean and trendy looking and we took a seat against the wall in the back We ordered the platter for two Since we had never been it felt like a good idea to try it ALL out GREAT idea We were delivered a platter of food that included two schnitzels two cabbage rolls 6 perogies and some other sides Everything was great but the schnitzel and cabbage rolls in particular were excellent I ordered two gravies to go with the schnitzel expecting two little Swiss Chaletsized gravies but instead we got two huge bowls of gravy Needless to say one bowl would have been more than enough for 2 people They were only $1 apiece so not the end of the world Plenty of food for two people and a great sampler platter to see what they have and what you likeService was fast and good and everything was excellent Totally recommend it and Ill be back Just thinking about it is making me salivate
Went in on a whim and was not disappointed I had the ODB and my husband had the poutine Poutine was goodhad pulled chicken on it and was tasty although not entirely unique tasting but thats fine for this type of place I had the ODB and it was AMAZEBALLS The chicken was a huge portion on a full waffle The waffle was the perfect blend of sweetness with just a bit of syrup and the chicken was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart It had a great sauce on top and the slight kick blended with the sweetness of the waffle was a great mix Portion size was good food was delicious Came with a little cup of potato saladliked the peas nice touch and the potato salad was a refreshing touch for the whole dish Still thinking about it hours laterthinking and thinkingsigh
On Sunday morning we went and got Montreal bagels and then walked to this parkits a bit of a hike but the weather was niceto see the tamtamsMy sister had really hyped the tamtams to me so I went in a bit skepticalbut she was right I cant really explain why this was so fantastic especially because really its a bit ridiculous This is a big park and I dont know it well enough to direct people to where exactly you need to go but by the large monument the one featured on the picture for this attraction you will find a group of drummers that set up here every Sunday Depending on the day there may be more or less Apparently the group can get pretty huge but either way they all gather around in a sort of circleand drum The environment is very comeasyouare read hippy but its such a laid back and accepting atmosphere The drummers just sort of jam together playing all sorts of different types of drums and bongos People go and dance in the middlekids go and pound on the drumslots of people get high Even not high this is a pretty fun thing to watch Its mesmerizing somehow Again I cant explain what made this so great We just sat back in the beautiful weather snacked on our bagels and watched the craziness unfold around us It was so unique and so weirdbut so musicalit was just cool to be a part of it
An awesome place to eat They are always very friendly and accommodating If your hungry for desert you can have fresh ice cream from their attached ice cream shop My family loves this place
Arti was fabulous and his designs spoke to my flair for bright colors and soft flowing feminine fabrics  Im a student of Dance and I was elated to see so many clothes that accentuate the artful gracefulness of movement To top it off the music playing softly in the background titillated my senses for the beautiful art of dance and everything beautiful  It was a beautiful experience meeting Arti and shopping at Vasari

Excellent Je recommande les yeux fermésUne belle expérience à découvrir et partagerBonne bouffe et et accueil WOW
I was looking for a nice place to take the family to dinner last night After reading the reviews and looking at the photos I settled on this place Great choiceThe ambience was perfect Nice and quite so you dont have to talk loud so your guests can hear youI was really surprised that on a Saturday night this place only had a few other tables with diners Youd think a place like this would be packedThe service is what really made this place great for me I would rate this place in the top two or three restaurants Ive ever eaten in as far as service goesThe food was good to Everyone in my party  of 6 enjoyed their meals I personally would rate my steak a 4 out of 5 But with the kind of service you get here I didnt mindThe total bill came to 274 and change for a party of 6 That includes one bottle of wine and a couple of other mixed drinks So really not a bad price for a place like thisIf youre looking for a romantic place to take a date or just a nice quiet place to dine I would highly recommend Carve
Its been a few years since Ive hiked this trail but I remember having a blast on it It was well defined and easy to follow all the way to the topI seem to recall the hike was about 6 miles round trip with about 2000 ft of elevation gainHeres a link with good directions to get to the trail head httpwwwmeetupcomVegasHikersevents8905143This is not an easy hike and youll want to make sure youre in decent shape Youll enjoy this hike more in the cooler months as there is not shade anywhere on the trail Doing this in the middle of summer could be a killer
This is one if my favorite trails in the Redrock canyon areaBe sure to visit the waterfall when youre out there The water flows to some degree most if the year although in the summer months it slows to a trickle
An old fashion candy store Whats not to likeIve been in here several times and have made several purchases Even if you dont buy anything its fun to look aroundI wont buy the corn or bacon soda again but it was still fun to try such a product
Ive often used this mountain as a quick workout as its not far from where I live You can find all the details of the hike at httpwwwbirdandhikecomHikeOtherAreasLoneMtLoneMthtmIts a steep 600 foot climb Hiking poles would come in handy as there are some really steep spots where its easy to slip on loose rocks The climb up is not too dangerous Most slips will only result in scratches and bruises but watch your step at the summit The top is very narrow a slip here could be disastrous Make sure you bring plenty of water Id avoid hiking this in the summer as there is absolutely no shade any where
I hiked to this peak a number of years ago I recall it being quite a work out I was in my mid 40s at the time and in fairly decent shape This isnt a hike youd want to do on a whim with no previous hiking experienceItll definitely have you gasping for breath and feeling the burn in your legsI do recall the climb was fairly straight forward meaning not much chance of getting lost I recall climbing to the ridgeline then just following it to the summit
If youve never been here and youre  visiting Vegas find the time to go visit this placeThis is the kind of place that makes you proud of what the human race can accomplish Along with taking some snapshots take whatever tour they currently have available to learn about how this place was built It really is amazing
Ive been coming here for decades Literally since the mid 70s The staff has always been friendly and courteous The doctors are always informative and willing to answer any questions or concerns I might haveI now live in Anaheim but was in town for my vacation I made it a point to stop in and have my eyes examined while I was in VegasIll be continuing to visit these folks for years to come
While staying at the hotel we took in a movie here Totally enjoyed this theatre Most comfortable seats Ive ever experienced at a movie theatre
This is an easy trail you can make it as short or as long as you like depending on your fitness levelGreat views of Lake Mead and the surrounding desertGreat views great hike historic significance Take the time to check this place out
Ive eaten here a couple of times Great food Friendly staff Excellent ambianceCant wait to visit here again
Spring Mountain National Recreation Area is a very generic term as theres so much that that title coversTheres hiking trails picnic areas motels restaurants skiing mountain biking campingif you enjoy the outdoors theres literally something for everyone hereIf you cant find something enjoyable to do up here youve got a problem
This is one of the best bars in town Not many of the yuppie types here Thank godGreat food friendly staff and customersKaraoke nights with James are a blast
Ive been in here a couple of timesToday I stopped in and wanted to pick up a few common wheat back pennies  a ounce of silver Their salesman Dominic was great Even though I wasnt spending a great deal of money he took the time to help me find exactly what I was looking forWhen it comes time to pick up those key dates Ill definitely come back here because of the great service
This has been my quick stop store for a number of years as its right across the street from where I liveIts always been quick and friendlyA great corner store
My dog is getting old and has been having some issues lately I also had some questionsSeeing the high Yelp reviews I thought Id give this place a try I called and was informed they were very busy today but could squeeze me in The Vet was awesome She took the time to answer all of  our questions regarding our aging dog She understood our concerns and seemed genuinely empatheticAlso found they board dogs here which is a big plus for us Im sure well be back if we have more issues or questions
Ive hiked this trail many times over the years every time its a beautiful experienceIts short enough and has enough elevation gain that its a good work out for higher and longer hikesBe sure to take a camera the views at the top are phenomenal
Ive been here a half a dozen times over the years Every visit was a pleasureThe god is good and the drinks are excellent Youll love the ambiance in the bar Its the perfect place to take a date
Ive been here a half a dozen times Always a great dining experience You dont get better than this for a mid range dining experienceAlways friendly and prompt service The place is always clean and we enjoy the ambianceWeve been there as a couple and with a larger groupno problemsIm sure Ill be visiting again
I love bars that are a bit out of the way The kind of places you really have to hunt down to findYoull find this little out of the way place on top of the Hump to Pahrump in the little community of Mountain SpringsBecause it sits at an elevation of about 5500 feet its always a bit cooler than down in the valley So its a nice place to go to escape the heat and get out of the valley for awhileThey have a couple of pool tables and a juke box Weekend its usually packed with bikers Often theyll have a live bandIf your looking for a out of the way place to have a drink this is it
Andra recently did our taxes We found her to be very nice She was helpful and explained things in a way that was easy to understandWed definitely use her again
This is probably my favorite place in all of the Redrock Canyon areaThe first part of the hike is typical desert Brush cactus rocks and dirtOnce you get into the canyon itself its very lush and greenBe sure to check out the creek It flows year round Ive been there in July and August and there was still water even at that hot time of yearIf you were only going to do one hike in the Redrock area this would be the one Id recommend
So I got home last night and was craving something to eat I didnt have much in the house because I hadnt been to the store in awhileI did a search for delivery on Yelp to see what would turn up Lo and behold I discovered this place was fairly close to me and Id never tried itSo having had a few beers and few shots of tequila I figured what the hell Ill give it a try I ordered a Hawaiian Pizza a order of wings and a bottle of Pepsi The food was at my door quicker than any delivery Ive ever hadIm very picky about wings Most places seem way under cooked for my taste These wings were great My only complaint was they had just a bit two much sauce on them Id probably strain them next time just to let a bit of it drip off But they were really tastyThe pizza was great So good in fact this is gonna be my new pizza place to order fromI only ordered a medium one last night as it was the first time Id ordered from them It was so good last night that I ordered a large one for breakfast LOL seriously Im typing this as I await its arrival Im just waiting to hit the post button until it arrives in case theyre slower this timeYepvery fast again Im off to have breakfast   
I live way out on the west side of Vegas and have on several occasions driven all the way to Boulder City for one of these burgersMy girlfriend and I stopped in again today and as usual the service was great The place was really packed and we had to stand around awhile to get a table We didnt mind as we know the food is worth the waitEven as busy as they were the staff remained friendly and cheerfulWell definitely be back again and again
We ate here a month or so ago and I cant wait to visit again It was my first visit and I really enjoyed itThe food was great Or maybe the Hurricane I had made it seem that wayPrompt and friendly service Great food Well be back soon
This is a wonderful hike on a well maintained and easy to follow trail Ive hiked this one a couple of times and look forward to doing it again
Ive hiked this canyon a couple of times The scenery is really amazing Reading the previous reviewers hike I had to laugh as for sometime I called this area Candycane Canyon before I learned what its real name wasAs mentioned this is a strenuous hike and not for a novice or someone out of shape
I have only three words for this place Yum Yum and Yum
Ive visited this place numerous times over the year The Magical Forest is always a magical experienceHighly recommended Dress warm as it can get chilly out there
Weve eaten here in the past but ate here again on Valentines Day The wait was an hour and a half but guess we should have expected this on ValentinesThe staff was outstanding We kept asking how long we had to wait Other people of course had the same question The hostess continually answered this question with a smile on her face all nightOur waitress was outstanding The food was incredible We even managed to force down a desert which is rare for usWell definitely be back again and again
What a fun and unique shop A great taste experience Highly recommended
Love these trails They interconnect with several other trails in the neighborhood so there are a variety of different routes that one can takeIve also seen security on bikes a few times while out on the trails so apparently they are regularly patrolled
This is place very great flavor Server was on top of things and everything that we ask for it was brought to us Chips and salsa given at the beginning of the meal had a great flavor as well The bread with the menudo was toasted and a spread of butter which gave it a home flavor I would gladly recommend this place I was going to give 4 stars instead of  5 stars because the Coke Zero had expired but was gladly replaced with a new one No questions asked Great service
Great pizza and wings for the prize Great flavor Wings were very good Timely in the order
Had the BEST time here with my husband celebrating our anniversary We had oysters crab dip ahi tuna burger and French sea bass Everything was phenomenal The food came out quickly and staff was friendly and attentive We will definitely be back again
Good hot coffee very friendly staff dog friendly and theyre open early enough for me to stop in before work Also the pastries look and smell AMAZING Havent had a chance to try them yet but Im definitely looking forward to it We have a lot of coffee shops downtown but this one seems like it will be a winner
This gem is tucked away in an alley at Green Valleys District area but dont let that fool you  going here you almost feel like youre no longer in Las Vegas Nevada but rather in a different part of the world  It has a romantic intimate feel  The food is delicious and the drinks are fantastic  I came here yesterday to meet someone and a friend of mine  Dominique  was bartending  Others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks and I will add on to those positive comments  Whether you ask for something on the menu or something not on the menu it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of Vegas  Ive lived here a little while and I can testify  They are thinking of adding live music soon out on the little patio out front with the right artists this can only add to the experience  Definitely recommended
My Valentines Day date took me here for dinner  First of all we were late for our reservation because my date had a corporate gig run late and they were extremely accommodating and friendly about it  When we arrived I got my fresh beautiful red rose all ladies who come here receive one and were seated immediately  We had a few different servers attend to us  one for wines one for our salad and another for the rest of our needs  I was blown away by the romantic setting incredible service and the impressive food  As a vegetarian your options are limited here but never fear  I had the vegetarian entree which changes by the day  When we went it was mushroom ravioli and oh wow  It was SO good  They were out of the raspberry cheesecake when we got to dessert so we chose the berry tarte instead Im glad they were out of the cheesecake because we wouldnt have gotten to try it otherwise  There are no words for how good it was  Everything about this experience was extremely positive  It is on the tad pricey side but if you want to really give a woman a romantic evening this is the perfect place to go unless youre vegan or a raw foodie that is  Thank you Hugos Cellar for a lovely evening
I moved here in February but even as a local I have to get my picture in front of this sign  When my dad came in to town to visit I had my excuse  Free parking and free to take pictures  Often there are tons of people and a long line to take your picture there so dont go during peak heat hours as  especially during the summer  it gets extremely hot between noon and 3 pm youll likely be standing there for a while before you can get your pictures  I took mine from way back to avoid the line  Voila
Ive been here twice and have had great food and aplus service both times  I love that theyre open 247 too  Its hard to find good nonfastfood restaurants with those hours so this place is a goto in that department as well  I cant remember what I had the first time I came here but most recently I had their ravioli  yum  Thanks Bootlegger
I loved this place  Whenever I visit somewhere or in this case move to a new city my favorite places to visit are the local aquariums  Really enjoyed every bit of this experience though all the sea turtles were my favorites  Also getting to pet the rays was really awesome  If youre coming through Vegas its a great place to visit no matter your age  Cant recommend this place enough
A girlfriend and I found our way here and it happened to be happy hour  We couldnt believe the prices especially for Tivoli Village  The wine was so good and the food was delicious as well  I think the guy who made our food was also our server which I appreciated since I really enjoyed what I ate and got to tell the chef in person how Much I enjoyed it  He is not only a great cook but an attentive and engaging server  I cant wait to come back here again
I went here last week with a friend and it was fantastic  First of all I love that they make the guacamole right in front of you  Very cool  And also it was very delicious  I got the vegetarian fajitas YUM and I had enough food for two more meals later  so definitely  value for your money  The service was also fantastic  I didnt even have to run out of water before the waiter was at my table giving me more  I think we had maybe three different waiters attending to different things at our table  All in all my friend and I felt very well taken care of  I recently moved here from the Midwest never going to eat Mexican back home again  Im too spoiled now  Great experience and delicious food
Never before have I experienced such a customizable pizza place and I love it  I especially appreciate the vegan cheese options as well as the awesome selection of toppings  So much fun and so much deliciousness  Cant wait to come back again
Wow  I loved this place  I had no idea what to get since Id never been there before but it seems like its a win no matter what you might choose  I cant wait to come back here many times to try different combinations  The staff here are all super nice people and our waitress checked on us lots of times to make sure we were taken care of and enjoying our meal  SO so good  If you havent tried this place and youre looking for something different go for it
Wow I love this place  Ive been to one of the other Sambalatte locations in town but I like this one better  The upstairs with recliners and little tea tables just adds to the cozy appeal  Their teas Ive now tried three different kinds are all great and my friend  who had the hot chocolate  said that was delicious as well   Their Christmas decorations that were up when I went were also adorable and pretty  Look forward to coming back here and maybe exploring Boca Park a little more as well
Really liked this place  I came here for the Rock Star Beer Fest only a bummer because they ran out of beer and wine so quickly and really liked the vibe of the place  Definitely plan on coming back here  and Ill swim then
Wowwww  Okay so  five star rating not easy to get from me  But this place HAS to be on my top ten favorite restaurants in Vegas as of this moment  Their hummus is out of this WORLD  I actually liked it more than the wrap that I had which was definitely tasty  Seriously  You have to go and try it for yourself  Its a hidden gem  You can easily miss it even looking for it as my date and I did  The service is also good  The people who work there are really nice so thats of course part of the five star rating  Its Mediterranean so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty but I wont let it go unsaid  Please just do yourself a favor  Go here and try it out yourself  If youre a hummus lover as I am your life is not complete without trying the hummus HERE  You can thank me later   
Definitely one of my favorite shows so far in Vegas  If you havent seen this show in a while then come back and check it out  apparently it changes pretty frequently so it can be a fresh experience if you see it from time to time  I was expecting to have a good time but if you let yourself get caught up in it youll be like me and have an absolute blast  Theres plenty of audience participation stuff which only adds to the fun of the experience  Cant wait to come back and see them again
Love the hiking you can do here  The railroad tunnel trail will give you spectacular views of Lake Mead as well as some history lessons if you stop and read all the signs  You can even walk past the boneyard which is a fenced off area where they keep old parts from the dam itself  You can either walk up on the bridge or down below by the bridge  I didnt do the tour inside the actual dam but maybe next time
Went here over Christmas to see the beautiful cactus garden all decked out in lights  it did not disappoint  A truly fun and beautiful display  This is definitely on my mustvisit list every Christmas as long as I live here  And best of all its free to visit and meander throughI have to be honest I dont like chocolate unless its very dark chocolate  That being said the friend I visited with and I shared a couple of bars we bought and they were both delicious  Its cool that they let you see the actual factory where they make it though I was disappointed because it wasnt really doing much of anything while I was there  I look forward to visiting here during other parts of the year when there arent lights on all the cacti but certainly also when its Christmas time again  = 
So happy I found this place  Theres a good reason for the five stars  Well actually plenty of good reasons  My friends and I had great service they had a veggie burger AND their salads had easily THE best croutons I have ever had in Vegas  Not your cheap breakyourteeth croutons I dread with most salads crispy on the outside and soft on the inside  Oh man  I am fangirling just remembering  The veggie burger was also delicious  Then again its hard to go wrong with veggie burgers since Ive never met one I didnt like  Plus theyre open 247 and the prices are good for Strip or near the Strip  Im sure Ill be back here again
Love watching these beautiful fountains whenever Im walking the Strip  Im a local and have gotten to experience them many times  I really like that theyre every 15 minutes if its anytime during the day and night before midnight you wont have to wait long to see a show  As of right now I havent experienced the same song twice  This and their indoor garden make the Bellagio my favorite casino in all of Las Vegas
If youre in this part of town and need quality alterations cannot speak to their drycleaning as I have not needed it this is the place  I love going in here because everyone is so nice to me  When I walked in for the first time the owner greeted me right away was very friendly and showed me to a dressing room  I had just bought a beautiful black dress but it was slightly too long needed straps shortened a seam resewn and a hook attached to the top of the zipper for all of this work it was $50  They could have had it done same day but since it was prom season and I didnt need it right away I didnt push for that  My dress now fits me absolutely perfectly and all the work they did looks beautiful  Im so happy  And this might be a small thing but when I was about to leave it started raining really hard and they offered me a seat and a bottle of water while I waited for the rain to stop  I really appreciate when a business cares not only about your business but you as a person too  Looking forward to bringing them more of my clothing to fix
Beautiful view  I came here for a hike with a meetup group and loved enjoying the gorgeous panoramic scene  I like getting neat photos and one where Im standing in two states at the same time is always up there on the list  Cant wait to come back with friends and family so they can enjoy as well
I dont give out many fivestar ratings but I love this place  Ive been vegetarian my whole life so Ive always been a fan of restaurants with this hippiehappy vibe  I love that one of their walls is covered in real greenery as well  Its about as much real greenery as youll see in one place in all of Vegas hahaThe food itself is so good  I wasnt feeling daring so I had their veggie burger  YUM  My friend and I also enjoyed their chips and beandip appetizer  Even my friend who isnt vegetarian enjoyed what he had  Their alcoholic drinks are not to be discounted either  The one we got for free for doing a Yelp check in was SO good  I cant remember what it was called but it was apple flavored  I also consider myself NOT a fan of alcohol in general so this is a huge compliment coming from me  I definitely plan on coming back here to be more daring and try everything on the menu
The service here was excellent  My boyfriend and I came here for dinner and we were seated almost immediately  The server checked on us a lot which I really appreciate  We had the chips and guacamole to start which was very yummy  I think I couldve made an entire meal of it haha  I got the tofu brown rice bowl which was absolutely and incredibly delicious  Im a lifelong vegetarian and a tofu snob when I say its good its good  I cant wait to come back here again the entire experience was wonderful
Came here late night with a friend and ordered the vegetarian fajitas  yum  Great service as well  We had a couple different wait staff take care of us other than our main waitress too  all very attentive  I never got to the bottom of my water glass  I really liked the decor here too  Great place cant wait to come back  Ive been to their other location in Henderson its a winwin
Wow  Just loved everything about this experience  The food was very delicious the waiters were constantly making sure we had enough water were satisfied with our food and were otherwise taken care of  The decoration of the place is cool too  definitely not what youd expect looking at it from the outside  And for all you vegetariansvegans theres plenty to eat here  and though I cant remember what dish I had the waiter picked it out for me it was SO good  Definitely a spot Ill come back to
I really enjoyed this restaurant and all it had to offer  The decor and atmosphere is intimate and romantic  dim lighting cool Africansafarithemed art on the walls etc  I had the Gardenburger and sweet potato fries for my meal and it was completely delicious  I also ordered a mojito  and as I say Ive never met a mojito I didnt like this one was particularly delicious  Although theres a specific recipe on the menu theyll flavorinfuse your mojito with any number of fruit options I chose pomegranate and it was Amazing  The waitress was very friendly provided recommendations for us and was very attentive to us the entire time we were there  I never got to the bottom of my glass of water in my mind a clear sign of great service  In addition the street surrounding this restaurant is beautiful and intimate especially at night lights strung from tree to tree brick street and classy shopping and eating venues  Definitely a fantastic date option  Cant wait to come back here again
HP wanted $300 to replace a 500GB hard drive  I was referred to Santos and he delivered  He is very friendly and professional  Price was more that fair for the expert knowledge he possescost me $165  May his business continue to prosper
First time visit today  I was doing the yummy after each bite  Seasoning was more than expected  Perfect thickness  loved the pricing compared to where I have been going for 4 yrsno more Papa Johns for me  Not stingy with toppings Thanks Mark for the good service  Will be back
LOVE LOVE this place Matt is friendly and knowledgeable as a personal trainer and never crowded  Club price is fair for what you need  Black car membership is worth itgotta have the hydro message or chair messages Always clean  Its a keeper
This has got to be the best pizza we have ever eaten  Its fabulous  The crust is out of this world and toppings are wonderful I recommend this place to everyone
Awsome place See cindy shes great for nails You have to have the deluxe pedi donethe hot rocks are wonderfulCall before going in esp on weekend as they do get really busy
I just love love this place  Very friendly staff and such a great place to go and shoot Love that its in doors and you get a place you can get out of the Vegas sun Will be going back for sure to keep up my skills and will be bringing along more friends the next time Seems 7 of us just wasnt quite enough Lol
This is one of the best looking bars I have ever seen in Las Vegas or elsewhere especially if you are on the middle level  It is almost a get away from the hectic pace of Las VegasThe service is good and the drink menu has some great options  Try the Fire Breathing Dragon  It taste good and has a nice side effect that everyone will enjoy
We returned to The Capital Grille this time with some friends I could not help myself and ordered the dry aged steak au poivre with a courvosier cream sauce again It did not disappoint The steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly The cream sauce adds a nice flavor Of course we had to have a side of the au gratin potatoes I had talked them up and after dinner everyone admitted we should have ordered at least one more order of them The service was very good The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable
We have stayed at Cosmo so many times We have ate at the restaurants inside so many times but had yet to visit Rose Rabbit Lie It is buried deep inside Cosmo just past the buffet The decor is cool and quite unique There is a big bar inside too if you have some time to kill before your reservationOn top of the dining experience you get entertainment Throughout our dinner there were various performances There were singers and dancers All of which were very good and entertaining They do not perform non stop so you get plenty of time to still eat and talkThey had a special Memorial Day Picnic themed option that night It was pricey but it was designed to feed multiple people When it came out we were shocked They actually ended up pulling the table next to us to our table so they could make room for everything The meal came with short rib on the bone turkey sausage beer can chicken corn mac and cheese and biscuits I may have missed something but you get the idea They really did a great job with the presentation too They put it on a huge platter and made it specialAll of the food was great We both loved the short rib The flavor was on point The sausage and chicken were good too but not on the level of the short rib It was so tender and flavorful The mac and cheese and corn were both very good The biscuits however were great Due to the immense size of our meal I did not get to enjoy more of them that night but wow were they goodI am comfortable saying the meal could have fed 4 people without a problem We took the leftovers back to LA the next day and got two meals out of themWe will certainly be back to try more of their regular menu items in the future This is a great place to enjoy a meal and be entertained The meal will be pricey but the experience makes it worth it
We sat at the bar for a few minutes while we waited for our table  They have an excellent selection of quality licquors  I was happy to see a good assortment of whiskeysWe started off the meal with the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido  It was excellent  By far the best queso fundido I have had maybe everThey bring a good variety of bread to the table  I am partial to the cornbread  It has little pieces of jalapeno baked inFor my entree I chose the Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbitt  It was great  It comes as a tenderloin and a leg  The meat was tender and the sauce added great flavor  Even the toasted cous cous was tastyThis place is always busy  Book your reservations several days in advance if you have a specific time in mind
Went last night for VDay and it was fantastic despite a very busy evening  Inside really not much different than the Atrias it replaced except for the pics of Big Mike  Had a couple of drinks at the bar and the bartender was quick witty and engaging although very busy  Nice job  We didnt get the VDay special 2 meals for $100 but went for the separate meals  Quick service drinks were promptly brought to the table as well as a bread basket which they even replaced for our takehome  Our server Peggy was prompt and on top of her game  I started with a Caesar Salad which was really enough for 2 and was excellent  Fresh and not too much dressing as they sometimes get Timing was perfect between courses and the meals were very well done  She got the twin lobster tails with asparagus and rice pilaf and I got the prime rib with a baked potato  The tails were perfect and the rice pilaf was a bit different but very fresh and not overly salty  My prime rib was a bit on the rare side which I usually order medium rare and a bit unevenly cooked  But the flavor and crust were phenomenal so that evened out to me  Every bite melted in your mouth  Never even used the au jus or horseradish sauce which was a bit too bland for me then again I used to grow my own  We dont do dessert but by the looks and empty plates from those around us they were excellent  Chef came out to check on our table which is always nice and management staff was active and busy even helping to clear tables with smiles on their faces  Not sure where the negative comments come from but Ive eaten in many fancier places and this stood right up to most of them  Maybe theyve upped their game and cleaned up the kinks  Ill definitely be back especially since its right down the street
Solid beers  Christmas Ale defines my holiday season  I moved away a long time ago but whenever I am home I try to make a stop at Great Lakes  Great vibe super chill stellar food and beer
I suppose I should write a review here since my little Noodleoo is currently serving as their spokes dog in the photos We both love Scooby Dos They treat my little buttfaced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that I perceive as being weird Like that funny poofy pompadour Mohawk it out yo Done In like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass Not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses He ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too So adorableThe shampoo they use here is also amazing Noodles usually smells like tacos a combination of beef stank and corn chips but after getting back from the Dos he smelled like Christmas morning Sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails Hes got some gender identity issues to deal with The pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there Im talking to you Petsmart Ive taken my other pup to Smelly Dog before but unless I need dog sitting play time after the cut Ill go with Scoobys They genuinely seem to like my little Noodle monster
Love love love A Taste of the Caribbean The braised oxtails are heavenly succulent and fall off the bone tender They had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal The plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce The jerk chicken was also fantastic but since I was so busy hoarding my oxtails I didnt get to try much of it The jerk was smoky spicy and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it Same sides so at least we didnt have to fight over those Make sure to try the hibiscus flower drink sorrel with cloves floating in it It accompanies the earthy spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at Mexican jointsThe atmosphere of this place is wonderfully warm and inviting The eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the Caribbean and the fauxrattan chairs help with the vibe too Theres also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place but who am I to judge decor Nothing in my house matches In that respect its kind of like being invited over to a friends house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your Kraft mac n cheese house Its clearly a family owned joint with all ages bumming around the kitchen Kiddos bring out water adolescents with hip hop ring tones take your order and the matriarchs keep them all in line Its energetic and engaging and utterly delicious Next time I need leave room for the cassava or coconut cake Much harder to do than you may think Trust meOh they also have some interesting breakfast options like smoked fish and such Dont worry they also have regular old eggs on the menu Check it out one morning for something outside of the norm
I stumbled upon this little shoppe I feel compelled to put the Old English spin on it since its such a cutesy little store when I was at my wits end It was my fathers birthday and I couldnt think of a thing to get the most unhelpful man ever Whatta you want Whatever Like what You dont have to get me anything Oh but I doMy beacon of hope was tucked away in a tiny little strip mall sandwiched by a Dunkin Donuts a Japanese food mart and a liquor store with a simple sign advertising Irish Gifts Salvation Hes all about heraldry and Irish pride but would the offerings be too chotchke to actually give anyone Like leprechaun print boxers and Kiss Me Im Irish ties hed only wear one day during the year Nope This place is a class act When I first entered the store I was shocked at how much stuff they had crammed onto the floor space It would have been claustrophobic had they not utilized barriers also decorated with stuff that lead you into different areas of the store The owners also run the place and immediately greeted me I was pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of Irish themed offerings They had everything from the goofy offerings I had imagined to beautiful jewelry china and crystal ware They even had a whole section of imported Irish food including tea sweets and refrigerated stuff like sausages He ended up with some glassware with decorative pewter insignias ranging from Celtic knots to Claddagh rings The people who own it are friendly and immediately helpful in finding anything you need ordering what they dont have or calling the competition to see if they can secure that special something something I appreciate Ive been frequenting the place since snatching up Guinness themed merchandise for friends and fun Irish gifts for other members of my family My dad even purchased his wedding rings from the place and a lovely Celtic cake topper of a man and woman with knot work circling itThe prices are a wee bit steep but they wont have your wallet crying out in protest And for imported goods at a specialty shop its completely understandable Dont forget to sign up for the Shamacus shamrockcactus nyuk nyuk a newsletter that arrives quarterly or so with all sorts of recipies stories and specials on their merchandise Youll want to keep in the know about the Highland games and how to make some wicked shepards pie
Cafe Monarch is everything the five star reviews make it out to be and more Its a must try for a unique brunchlunchdinnerwhatever experience in the valley Im reluctant to review this place since I dont want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch but my taste buds will not be deterred Plus I have until September before they reopen so theres plenty of buffer roomIts an impromptu flybytheseatofwhateverthecheffeelslikewhippingup type place The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question Sweet or savory So whatever you do leave those picky eater at home When it comes to dinner you dont want a wonderbread palate Um I dont eat anything green influencing the meal Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces No exaggeration his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces Its like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for youThe fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner and the fact that I dont have to pay a restaurant markup is ideal Hes also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning Theres a $10 corking fee but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that its a screaming deal Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food drink and atmosphere It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef who doubles as the waiterbussertodos to your last scrumptious bite Totally worth every minute of waiting Also you might not want to come here starvin marvin And definitely dont invite anyone you cant stomach hanging out with for a couple hours Lets wrap it upDont bring picky eatersDont come so hungry that youd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkillDont bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because youve got to be around that for hours man HoursDo BYOB and dont be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa funDo bring cash only and tip very very well He deserves itI now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer Use it wisely
I awake wild eyed in a cold sweat visions of caramel creme macaroons soliciting me like high class tricks in a whorehouse Croque Monsieurs their swanky pimps demanding payment for service Essence strikes again The only way to vanquish these dreams is to lunch here on a regular basis Ive been here twice in the past week alone and I think Im addicted The atmosphere product service and baked goods have seduced me with their simple elegance The only gripe I possibly have about this place is the fact that the parking lot is the size of a matchbox and with Sacks Cafe Lalibella and Starbucks all occupying the same plaza finding a place to park during the busy lunch rush is like simultaneously playing Tetris and FroggerThe atmosphere at Essence is understated in its sophistication Windows line the majority of the dining room creating an inviting open air feeling and the attached patio is charming Strong earth toned colors and cute little origami flower bouquets grace the tables Despite the small size of the establishment there are a variety of seating options for single patrons or small groups and Ive never seen people waiting for a table even during their busiest Friday lunch rushA broad array of patrons frequent Essence including hipsters young professionals older adults in their power suits and even a few elders I havent seen very many college kids which may because the food isnt cheap and its probably weirder than options on Mills strip But I dig the weird French inspired cuisine Its decadent and I feel naughty eating itEverything Ive eaten during lunch has been exceptional The croque moniseur is far and away the best thing Ive tried so far A grilled sandwich with an egg washed top layer thin sliced ham creamy gruyere cheese and jalapenos Its heavenly crunchy just as the name suggests The open face steak sandwich is tender delicious and smothered in buttery sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of bleu cheese crumbles as a savory accent The layers of phyllo dough used in the spanakopita demonstrates some serious painstaking dedication to producing a good product and the chopped Greek salad was phenomenal Crispy cucumbers bell peppers kalmata olives feta cheese and tomatoes that tasted like well actual tomatoes for once Something that you dont often find and an indication that Essence uses amazingly fresh organic product whenever possible Even the side of potato salad with whole grain mustard was exceptionalThe offerings at their bakery are just as phenomenal as their lunch entrees The caramel creme macaroon is seriously the most amazing sandwich cookie Ive ever tasted a perfect harmony between savory creme filling and sweet chewy wafers The strawberry shortcake is amazingly fresh and light if not a little hard to eat And their white chocolate raspberry layer cake is the classiest Little Debbieesque snack cake Ive ever had the pleasure of tasting One day I vow to pick up a box of Tasty little treats just so I can sample a cupcake and about three cookies without having to choose among all the desserts on displayI highly recommend this place Just dont be surprised if you develop an insatiable desire to consume Essence on a daily basis
