['INTEREST rates are heading higher and that is likely to put financial markets under strain   Investors and regulators would both dearly love to know where the next crisis will come from  What is the most likely culprit  Financial crises tend to involve one or more of these three ingredients  excessive borrowing  concentrated bets  and a mismatch between assets and liabilities  The crisis of 2008 was so serious because it involved all three—big bets on structured products linked to the housing market  and bank balance sheets that were both overstretched and dependent on short term funding  The Asian crisis of the late 1990s was the result of companies borrowing too much in dollars when their revenues were in local currency  The dotcom bubble had less serious consequences than either of these because the concentrated bets were in equities  debt did not play a significant part  It may seem surprising to assert that the genesis of the next crisis is probably lurking in corporate debt  Profits have been growing strongly  Companies in the S P 500 index are on target for a 25  annual gain once all the results for the first quarter are published  Some companies  like Apple  are rolling in cash  But plenty are not  In recent decades companies have sought to make their balance sheets more  efficient  by raising debt and taking advantage of the tax deductibility of interest payments  Businesses with spare cash have tended to use it to buy back shares  either under pressure from activist investors or because doing so will boost the share price  and thus the value of executives  options   At the same time  a prolonged period of low rates has made it very tempting to take on more debt  S P  a credit rating agency  says that as of 2017  37  of global companies were highly indebted  That is five percentage points higher than the share in 2007  just before the financial crisis hit  By the same token  more private equity deals are loading up on lots of debt than at any time since the crisis  One sign that the credit quality of the market has been deteriorating is that  globally  the median bond s rating has dropped steadily since 1980  from A  to BBB   The corporate bond market is divided into investment grade  debt with a high credit rating  and speculative  or  junk   bonds below that level  The dividing line is at the border between BBB  and BB   So the median bond is now one notch above junk  Even within investment grade debt  quality has gone down  According to PIMCO  a fund management group  in America 48  of such bonds are now rated BBB  up from 25  in the 1990s  The companies that issue them are also more heavily indebted than they used to be  In 2000 the net leverage ratio for BBB issuers was 1 7  It is now 2 9  Investors are not demanding higher yields to compensate for the deteriorating quality of corporate debt  quite the reverse  In a recent speech during a conference at the London Business School  Alex Brazier  the director for financial stability at the Bank of England  compared the yield on corporate bonds with the risk free rate  the market s forecast for the path of official short term rates   In Britain investors are demanding virtually no excess return on corporate bonds to reflect the issuer s credit risk  In America the spread is at its lowest in 20 years  Just as low rates have encouraged companies to issue more debt  investors have been tempted to buy the bonds because of the poor returns available on cash  Mr Brazier also found that the cost of insuring against a bond issuer failing to repay  as measured by the credit default swap market  fell by 40  over the past two years  That makes it seem as if investors are less worried about corporate default  But a model looking at the way that banks assess the probability of default  compiled by Credit Benchmark  a data analytics company  suggests that the risks have barely changed over that period  So investors are getting less reward for the same amount of risk  Combine this with the declining liquidity of the bond market  because banks have withdrawn from the market making business  and you have the recipe for the next crisis  It may not happen this year  or even next  But there are already ominous signs  Matt King  a strategist at Citigroup  says that foreign purchases of American corporate debt have dried up in recent months  and the return on investment grade debt so far this year has been  3 5   He compares the markets with a game of musical chairs  As central banks withdraw monetary stimulus  they are taking seats away  Eventually someone will miss a seat and come down with a bump \n']

['BOSTON parents were fed up  To get their children into public schools they had to submit a list of their preferences  Spots were allocated first to those who put a school top  Only then would schools consider pupils who put them second or third  Sounds fair  Hold on  The best schools are popular  Picking them risks rejection  Good schools are sought after  too  If put second they may also fill up  leaving only places at worse schools  Should parents aim for the best and risk mediocrity  or settle for the good  On April 20th the American Economic Association  AEA  awarded the John Bates Clark medal  given annually to a leading economist under 40  to Parag Pathak of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  He researches market design—eg  creating mechanisms to allocate resources without money  such as school places in Boston  Solutions he devised there have been applied widely  from New York to New Orleans  The AEA says that by improving pupil allocation Mr Pathak had  influenced the lives of over 1m public school students   In Boston  as a graduate student at Harvard  Mr Pathak worked with his mentor Alvin Roth  since awarded a Nobel prize  on a new system  It asks pupils and schools to list each other from first to last  A computer program offers places to pupils that schools put top  Pupils take the best offer and reject the rest  Schools work down the list making fresh offers as rejections occur  with each pupil keeping a single  most preferred  offer  Parents no longer need strategies  Mr Pathak has since pondered related questions  such as whether parents can truly judge schools  quality  In Boston  he found that charter schools  public schools exempt from some regulation  improved the performance of disadvantaged pupils  Children randomly allocated places there tended to flourish  those elsewhere languished  Parents spotted high achievement  and applications rolled in  But in New York  where parents pay handsomely to live near elite schools  he showed that whether pupils just squeak in or just miss out  they do equally well and attend similar colleges  The best schools get the best pupils  but may not make them better  When he was growing up in New York state  Mr Pathak  used to dream about attending a selective public school in New York City   It seems that he needn t have worried \n']

['THE late Hans Rosling is best known for his Ted talks  here is one on the wonders of the washing machine   Sadly he died last year  But before he did so  he worked with his son and daughter in law to write  Factfulness  Ten Reasons Why We re Wrong About the World—And Why Things Are Better Than You Think   It is a wonderful book  full of humour and humility  and it paints an optimistic picture of progress  Take his 13 question test and you will probably be surprised  For example  has the proportion of people in the world living in extreme poverty over the last 20 years almost doubled  stayed the same  or almost halved  Over the last 100 years  has the number of deaths per year from natural disasters more than doubled  stayed the same or more than halved  In both cases  the answer is the most optimistic one  the latter statistic is particularly remarkable given the increase in the size of the population over the past century  Perhaps because the news media focuses on bad news  and because political unrest in the rich world has grown so much  it is easy to miss the very good story that has been happening in Asia and elsewhere over the past 30 years  In part  this is down to the escape from baleful ideology  To quote Stephen Radelet s  The Great Surge    In 1976  Mao single handedly and dramatically changed the direction of global poverty with one simple act  he died  Mr Rosling had little truck with those who would deny the benefits of industrialisation  including washing machines  to those living in poor countries  But his great gift was to deliver his data with

['THE Hong Kong dollar is one of the most and least manipulated monies in the world  For over 34 years the territory s monetary authority  the HKMA  has kept it pegged to America s currency at around HK 7 80 to the dollar  resisting all temptations to let it fall or rise  In 2005 it refined the peg with two promises  to buy dollars at the price of HK 7 75 and to sell them for HK 7 85  The strength of the Hong Kong dollar has obliged the HKMA to keep the first promise many times since  Its purchases of American dollars have even drawn the accusation that it manipulates its currency for competitive advantage  In fact  the HKMA has always been ready to manipulate its currency upwards  too  But since 2005 it has had no occasion to  until last week  On April 12th the Hong Kong dollar weakened to HK 7 85  forcing the authority to buy HK 51bn over the next few days in exchange for American dollars  The Hong Kong dollar s weakness reflects the gap between rising American interest rates and Hong Kong s low borrowing costs  In other places  investors might worry that the central bank s efforts to defend its currency would exhaust its dollar reserves  But the HKMA has enough foreign assets to buy its entire money supply  strictly defined  with plenty to spare  Long before that point its purchases of Hong Kong dollars  which withdraw them from circulation  would reduce the money supply enough to force up interest rates  making the currency more attractive and arresting its weakness  The only worry—for homeowners—is that higher interest rates would weigh on Hong Kong s property prices  which have risen by 30  in the past two years  Hong Kong s peg to the dollar has survived three global slowdowns  several stockmarket crashes  an Asian financial crisis  a global one  an epidemic and the handover from one of the world s first capitalist countries to its largest communist one  It has little to fear from several further hikes in America s benchmark interest rate  \n']

['Tesla Inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential  sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track  Tesla s future depends on the Model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks  with Musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months  Musk plans to shut down its Fremont  California factory for 10 days in the second quarter but said Tesla will meet the production target of 5 000 Model 3s per day by the end of June  as planned  and will turn a profit in the second half of the year  To achieve profitability  Musk will have to reverse what today amounts to a  22 584 pre tax loss per vehicle built by the Silicon Valley company  Tesla posted its biggest ever quarterly loss when it announced first quarter results on Wednesday  Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call  when Musk began cutting analysts  questions short  costing Tesla over  2 billion in market capitalization   These questions are so dry  They re killing me   Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars  an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles  Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off  He then took several questions in a row about plans

rs 2p6EbiR  5 000 MODEL 3s PER WEEK Musk s ability to run Tesla is crucial as the company strives to efficiently and profitably build its first vehicle intended to be produced at high volume  the Model 3  Musk acknowledged error recently in over automating the Model 3 assembly line  which has resulted in production delays  but it is still unclear how long and costly it will be to unwind this mistake  Delayed Model 3 production also comes as a slew of competitors bring new electric vehicle models to market  The company stood by a previously announced target of building 5 000 Model 3s per week by the end of June  Tesla s capital expenditures declined in the quarter and the company cut its spending forecasts for 2018  saying it would spend less than  3 billion  Tesla spent  3 4 billion in 2017   bit ly 2jn15SB  Investing com analyst Clement Thibault said the reduction was noteworthy   but in the long run given challenges that lay ahead of Tesla  I don t think it is going to make or break the company   Tesla  is definitely not in a minimizing cost stage   Thibault said  Free cash flow  a key metric of financial health  widened to negative  1 billion in the first quarter from negative  277 million in the fourth quarter  excluding costs of systems for its solar business  Analysts had not expected so much spending  predicting hundreds of millions of dollars less in so called cash burn  according to Thomson Reuters data  Tesla did not break out a cash flow calculation that it had included in previous quarters  The niche carmaker  which two years ago vowed to build 500 000 vehicles annually in 2018  has attracted legions of fans for its advanced technology and design  But the company rushed its Model 3 to market  making mistakes in manufacturing whose effects are now being felt  and investor skepticism has risen  Questions over Tesla s finances are top of mind  and many analysts anticipate a capital raise in 2018 despite Musk s statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters  Tesla said gross margins on the Model 3  which today are slightly negative  would be close to flat in the second quarter and grow to  highly positive  in the second half of the year  Tesla said it produced 2 270 Model 3s per week in the last week of April  It said net reservations for the Model 3  including configured orders not yet delivered  exceeded 450 000 at the end of the first quarter  Automotive revenue rose only 1 percent from the prior quarter to  2 74 billion  RECORD LOSS Tesla reported a record loss of  709 6 million  or  4 19 per share  for the first quarter ended March 31  compared with a loss of  330 3 million  or  2 04 per share  a year earlier  Excluding items  Tesla had a loss of  3 35 per share  Analysts had expected a loss of  3 58 per share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S  The company said it ended the quarter with  3 2 billion in cash after spending  655 7 million in quarterly capital expenses  The lack of Model 3 revenue has exacerbated Tesla s cash burn as the company continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on multiple projects in the pipeline  such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory  The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla  which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months  \n']

['WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and expressed confidence that a recent rise in inflation to near the U S  central bank s target would be sustained  leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June  The upgrading of the Fed s inflation outlook represented a milestone after roughly six years of price gains falling short of its 2 percent goal  even as key aspects of the economy saw a healthy recovery from the 2007 2009 recession  The Fed s rate setting committee also downplayed a recent slowdown in economic and job growth  saying activity had been expanding at a moderate rate and job gains  on average  had been strong in recent months  It said inflation had  moved close  to its target and that  on a 12 month basis is expected to run near the Committee s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term   The Fed s decision to leave its benchmark overnight lending rate in a target range of between 1 50 percent and 1 75 percent was unanimous  Investors had all but ruled out another increase at this week s meeting  The Fed raised rates in March and currently forecasts another two increases this year  although an increasing number of policymakers see three as possible  Investors overwhelmingly expect a rate hike at the June 12 13 policy meeting  After the release of the Fed s statement  traders of U S  short term interest rate futures kept bets that rates would rise at least two more times in 2018  U S  stocks pared losses before turning lower  Treasury yields briefly edged higher  and the dollar  DXY was off its highs of the day against a basket of currencies   There are some changes in the statement to reflect the evolution of the data especially in their inflation outlook   said Stephen Stanley  chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities in Stamford  Connecticut   I think a June rate hike is a done deal unless something dramatically changes between now and June   ROBUST ECONOMY The Fed s confidence in the economic outlook was also highlighted by its assertion that business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly  It added that risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced  removing a prior reference to  near term risks   Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has maintained that the central bank will pursue a middle of the road approach to monetary policy  continuing to gradually lift rates in the face of a robust economy that had yet to spark a jump in inflation  But data released on Monday showed price gains are now effectively at the Fed s target  The Fed s preferred measure of inflation soared 1 9 percent in the 12 months through March  the biggest increase since February 2017  after increasing 1 6 percent in the year through February  the U S  Commerce Department reported  Fed policymakers had anticipated the rise and have stressed that their target is not a ceiling and that they will tolerate increases above it without being immediately concerned  The Fed s pace of rate increases has picked up since it began its tightening cycle in December 2015  It raised rates once in 2016  but lifted borrowing costs three times last year amid a strengthening economy and labor market  Although economic growth slowed to an annualized rate of 2 3 percent in the first quarter  a period that has tended to be weaker in recent years  and job gains cooled in March  a pickup is expected in the months ahead  fueled in part by the Trump administration s tax cuts and fiscal stimulus  The economy is now in its second longest expansion since World War Two  The unemployment rate is at a 17 year low of 4 1 percent  below the Fed s longer run estimate of what constitutes full employment  and there are signs wages are moving firmly higher after an extended period of sluggishness  The Fed s policy statement made no mention of the economic risks posed by mounting trade tensions between the United States and other nations  particularly China  Fed policymakers had flagged the potential negative impact of the conflict in recent public comments  but adopted a wait and see attitude  \n']
